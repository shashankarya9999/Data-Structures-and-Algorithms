1) **TV commercial placement**:<br>
    Select a set of TV commercials(each commercial has duration and cost) so that the total revenue is maximal while the total length does not exceed the length of the available time slot.

2) **Optimizing data centre performance**:<br>
    Purchase computers for a data center to achieve the maximal performance under limited budget.
