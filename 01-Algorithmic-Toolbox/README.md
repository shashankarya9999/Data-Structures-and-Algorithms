1) [**Computing Fibonacci Numbers**](https://www.cs.usfca.edu/~galles/visualization/DPFib.html): To better appreciate the difference between polynomial time and exponential time algorithms, try computing F<sub>20</sub> using this visualization. For this, enter "20" into the field and press "Fibonacci Recursive". This calls a recursive algorithm that makes an endless number of recursive calls. This call will never end even if you increase the visualization speed to maximum. Stop this call by pressing "Skip Forward" and press "Fibonacci Table". This will call an iterative algorithm that uses an array to compute Fibonacci numbers efficiently. The third button calls a recursive algorithm with memorization. We will cover such algorithms in the Dynamic Programming module. (Note that the visualization uses a slightly different definition of Fibonacci numbers: there, F<sub>0</sub> = F<sub>1</sub> = 1, and in the lecture, F<sub>0</sub> = 0, F<sub>1</sub> = 1. This, of course, has no influence on the running time.)
