# Data Structures and Algorithms

I am currently enrolled in the UC San Diego Data Structures and Algorithms specialization on Coursera. I am planning to complete all 6 courses which constitute this specialization. I will be regularly updating this repository with new assignments and insights. I will be using mainly Python and C++ as my primary languages for this specialization. 

I am planning to learn Java in the second half of this year if I am not burdened with academic responsibilities. If I am able to do so, then I will do all the problems in this repository in Java.
