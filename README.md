# Data Structures and Algorithms

I am currently enrolled in the UC San Diego Data Structures and Algorithms specialization on Coursera. I am planning to complete all 6 courses which constitute this specialization. I will be regularly updating this repository with new assignments and insights. I will be using mainly Python and C++ as my primary languages for this specialization. I am planning to learn Java in the second half of this year if I am not burdened with too many academic responsibilities. If I am able to do so, then I will do all the problems in this repository in Java.

This specialization constitutes of 6 courses: 
1) Algorithmic Toolbox
2) Data Structures
3) Algorithms on Graphs
4) Algorithms on Strings
5) Advanced Algorithms and Complexity
6) Genome Assembly Programming Challenge

The file structure of this repository is pretty straightforward. I have six directories, one for each course. The programs and resources of each course are present in the six directories. In the repository, There is also a LEARNINGS.md file which consists of various helpful insights I gained, during my journey through the vast landscape of Data Structures & Algorithms. At last, I must mention the Reference Material directory consisting of reference material of Data Structures & Algorithms and related topics in general.
